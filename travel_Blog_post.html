        <p>HI, I'M XYZ.<br>
            I'VE BEEN STUMBLING MY WAY AROUND THE WORLD FOR 10 YEARS AND COUNTING.</p>
        <p>It was back in 2011 when I quit my job, sold everything I owned, and left home with a one-way ticket in hand. Everyone told me I was making a huge mistake. At the time, I had zero travel experience and had no idea what I was getting myself into.
        </p><p>Like a lot of people, I hoped travel would solve everything. I set off convinced my trip would be all about incredible, life-changing moments; ones full of sunsets and rainbows and meaningful experiences. Instead, I stumbled headfirst into disaster.
        </p><p>Over the past 10 years of travel, I've been scammed in China and robbed in Tanzania; I've face-planted into a sand dune in Namibia and fallen into a leech-infested rice paddy in Indonesia. I accidentally ate a cockroach in Laos, contracted cholera in Borneo, and flashed my tour group in the Cook Islands. It's hard to believe, but my bad luck was the best thing to ever happen to me.</p>
